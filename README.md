# About our page
Our team’s job is Player Support. There are many problems with playing games. For instance, you want to play League of Legends, but game won’t run on your computer. Our team works for users with problems. First, we create a search bar at the top. This bar helps players can search their problems quickly. Next to this, you can see the button that show users the most frequent problems like billing/cash issues, get technical problem, problem in game, report(declaration) the player. Click this button to see various information related to the problem and we show that FAQ.

Next, the problems are divided into categories. This tab covers all the issues that you think arise during the playing game. We divided the categories into Game client download, installin, Account recovery or safety, Ranked system and rewards, Hardware problems, Bug, Login, Patching, Billing/cash, Reporting(declaration), Events. All content receives a solution from the relevant department(Game Design, Marketing and so on.) and delivers it to the users.

Last, if user can’t find what user’s looking for, users can submit a Ticket(report). After we receive the ticket, we will ask the department. And we will deliver the solution separately to user. We repeat this situation, accumulate data and list them on web pages for users with the same problems.
